1.”Software engineering is part of system engineering process”do you agree? Justify your answer.

No, this is because,Software engineering concern about the designing and developments engineering specified software of the highest quality and should have broad information  system experience 
And
System engineering highly concerns on the hardware part of the project. It deals with logistics, team coordination, automatic machinery control, work processes and similar tools.
But in as much as any other engineering discipline relevant to the System of Interest is. Thus, if such a system has a software component that needs to be created, then Software Engineering will likely be a part of the overall design and development process. If the system is mechanical, then likely not.

2.Software crisis 
Software crisis is a term used in the early days of computing science for the difficulty of writing useful and efficient computer programs in the required time. The software crisis was due to the rapid increases in computer power and the complexity of the problems that could now be tackled. With the increase in the complexity of the software, many software problems arose because existing methods were inadequate.

3.Professional Responsibilities of a software engineer 
As a software engineer, you'll need to:
* analyse user requirements
* write and test code, refining and rewriting it as necessary and communicate with any programmers involved in the project
* research, design and write new software programs (e.g. business applications or computer games) and computer operating systems
* evaluate the software and systems that make computers and hardware work
* develop existing programs by analysing and identifying areas for modification
* integrate existing software products and get incompatible platforms to work together
* create technical specifications
* write systems to control the scheduling of jobs or to control the access allowed to users or remote systems
* write operational documentation with technical authors

4.Component-based Software Engineering allows faster delivery”. State whether this statement is true or false. Justify your answer

This is true. Since software is developed for specific components, it is easier to test and use versions created for previous models of components.
